Idea:

1 dome in the middle


5 difficulties:

Easy/Normal/Hard/Hard+/Challanging/Ch4o2

Each difficulty gives siege tokens [easy->hard+ +1(each); hard+->Challanging +2; Challanging->Ch4o2 +4]

+1 dome: 2 tokens
Max tier upgrade (3->4): 5 tokens
Ally upgrade/Ascending: 1 Token [One player can become an ally, or upgrade an already existing one]
Summon Friendly rouges [3x]: 1 token

After each defeat of siege gamemode the token count resets, but if you win the Ch4o2 difficulty, you get 5 instant siege Tokens for the next siege rounds(3 of them)
