Added new weapons
Balanced some tanks:
1) inferno has now more damage but smaller radius
2)spikes and similar bodies now have more damage and speed
3)buffed hp and bodydamage of saw and ziggurat
4)removerd the heal aura of "Pathogen", nerfed the big cannon and added 4 other mini cannons
5)added 2 new small guns to gunner
6) traps will have WAY less penetration, but more lifetime
7)thinking about new tiers
8)an juggernaut(body upgrade) will be added, its slow and has a good hp multiplier, but is more durable at hight penetration bullets
9)thinking about buffing spread's bullet speed

this is a few of the things i changed, the list will be updated sooner or later :P
